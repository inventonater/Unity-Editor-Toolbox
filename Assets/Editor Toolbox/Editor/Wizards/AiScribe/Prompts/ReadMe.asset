  text: 'Help me write a README.md for these files.  Include a lot of detail and
    specificity.

    It should use neutral language, be a thorough and useful introduction
    to the classes,  methods, and fields.  Describe their purpose and briefly describe
    the way they work.

    Make sure to cover any features or patterns which might
    be unusual, unintuitive, or unfamiliar to junior Unity developers.  Use best
    practices for the markdown, including relative links to the local files for the
    major sections.'
